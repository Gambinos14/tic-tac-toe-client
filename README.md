# Tic Tac Toe - El ClÃ¡sico (Barcelona vs Real Madrid)

> Click the URL above and play out El ClÃ¡sico in a tic tac toe game which can
> be played by a single user or two users on the same device.

### Technologies Used:

HTML5, CSS, SASS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX

### Game Logic:

> A soccer inspired game of tic tac toe for lovers of European soccer. User 1
> will always go first and their icon will replace an X in the game logic.
> The game will alternate between game icons and will report scores based on
> the number of wins by player 1 (aka 'X') and player 2 (aka 'O'). Players can
> change icons every time they log in to play with a different team each time!

### Challenges:

> I discovered a bug which occasionally places the wrong game piece on the
> board ... I will continue to test the application to make sure that this
> bug is resolved. There is an issue displaying the game view on larger
> monitors; however, the game works fine on most laptops, tablets and phones.
> The next release of the game will have to address this display issue.

>As a user I want the site to know who's turn it is so there isn't any confusion between x's and o's.
>As a user I also want to be able to play the game correctly, such that the same move can't be made twice in one game.
>As a user I want to be able to restart a game whenever I like in case I messed up a move.
